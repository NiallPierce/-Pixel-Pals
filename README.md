## Features

  - This section includes fully reponsive internal links to take the users to each part of the page which includes Home, About Us, Sign Up and Contact Us. The bar remains in place while the users scrolls down.
  - This will allow the user ease of access to any section of the page in the click of a button.
  - Keeping it white at the top allowed for it stand out more against the black background when the user first visits the page.

### Future Features 

- Some features I'd like to add in the future would be to add a page going into more detail about upcoming events and tournaments.
- Another page with more information on give aways and include a gallery. 

## Testing 

- Tested Nav Menu to make sure that the users would be brought to the correct location and not brought there within a new tab.
- Tested Video to make sure it was on an loop and more importantly that the user had the control over the video and could pause and play as they wished.
- Tested Flip Cards with mousing over each of them so that they worked as intended and rotated correctly.
- Tested the Sign Up section so that each section would be required in order to submit the form. I also made sure that Email Address was required as email so that the user would have to enter a valid email address to proceed and I also tested the drop down menu so that it would and displayed the correct content.
- Tested Google Map in Contact Us section to make sure it could be moved correctly by the user.


### Bugs

- When positioning the video, the width kept pushing the screen out to right on medium to small screens. Corrected this by adjusting size to 100% on each Media
- Nav bar wouldn't spread across the top, I used the Love Running site to help me space evenly.
- An incorrect pathing to the main hero image wasn't loading it. Adjusted pathing to fix this. 

### Smaller Screens

- Different media queries allowed me to make sure the site worked and fit correctly. I adjusted the video to sit below the About Us section on smaller screen and the Flip Cards to sit in a column.


![Media Queries](assets/images/media-Read.jpg)

- Medium to Large Laptops the Flip Cards are kept in a row while the video is still moved top the bottom of About Us section.
