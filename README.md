## Features 

- __Navigation Bar__

  - This section includes fully reponsive internal links to take the users to each part of the page which includes Home, About Us, Sign Up and Contact Us. The bar remains in place while the users scrolls down.
  - This will allow the user ease of access to any section of the page in the click of a button.
  - Keeping it white at the top allowed for it stand out more against the black background when the user first visits the page.
